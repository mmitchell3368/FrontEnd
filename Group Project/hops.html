				<figcaption>
					<h2>Type: Cascade</h2>
					<h2>Roots:</h2><p>Cascade was developed in the USDA breeding program at Oregon State University, 
						and released to the public in 1972. It was originally created from a cross between Fuggle 
						and the Russian hop Serebrianka in 1967. Cascade was initially only known by its number 
						designation of USDA 56013.</p>
					<h2>Flavor & Aroma:</h2><p>Cascade is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process.
						Cascade is the hop variety that made hops famous. It single-handedly defined the American Pale Ale style.
						Defined by its citrus, and often more specifically grapefruit flavor, this hop accounts for around 10% of the US's harvest of hops. 
						Cascade also has a medium-intense floral and spice citrus qualities. When used as a bittering hop, it imparts moderate bitterness. 
						It is most famous for being the finishing hop in Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale, widely considered the beer that launched the IPA and 
						bitter beer craze.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<h2>Type: Mosaic</h2>
					<h2>Roots:</h2><p>Mosaic is the daughter of the Simcoe (YCH 14) hop and a Nugget-derived male which had a linage including Tomahawk, 
						Brewers Gold, Early Green, and an unknown variety. It was released to the craft brewing scene in 2012 by the Hop Breeding Company (HBC).</p>
					<h2>Flavor & Aroma:</h2><p>Mosaic is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process.
						Mosaic offers a unique and complex blend of floral, tropical, fruity, and earthy characteristics that translate very favorably 
						into several different styles of beer, although it is primarily used in IPAs.
						Mosaic's complex flavor and aroma profile led to its name. This hop is most noted for its blueberry and tropical aromas, but is 
						also known to have citrus, grassy, pine, spice, tangerine, papaya, rose, earthy, floral (blossoms), and bubble gum descriptors.
						The aroma/flavor descriptors for the wildly popular Mosaic hop commonly include fruity (blueberry), citrus (tangerine, grapefruit), 
						tropical (mango, guava), floral, and earthy. The combination of these aroma/flavor descriptors with the relatively high alpha-acid 
						levels allows this hop to serve a dual purpose, as both a bittering and flavor/aroma hop in the brewing process. Ultimately, Mosaic 
						provides flavor and aroma profiles in beer that simply cannot be accomplished with other hop cultivars.</p>

				<img src="Images/hopsimgs/amarillo.png" alt="Amarillo" class="fig-img">
				<figcaption>
					<h2>Type: Amarillo</h2>
					<h2>Roots:</h2><p>The Amarillo hop variety was accidentally discovered by Virgil Gamache Farms in 1990 when they found it growing alongside 
						their Liberty hop field. They began cultivating it in 1991, then patented it as a new variety in 2003. It was originally patented 
						under the identifier of VGXP01. It was released to the public shortly after receiving the patent.
						Amarillo is sometimes referred to as Amarillo Gold.</p>
					<h2>Flavor & Aroma:</h2><p>Amarillo is an aroma hop that is typically used in only late boil additions, including dry hopping.
						Amarillo hops impart a distinct flowery, spicy, tropical, citrus-like flavor and aroma in beer. The citrus has qualities 
						of orange and lemon, like Cascade, but much stronger. Other aroma descriptors include grapefruit, melon, apricot and peach.
						Amarillo hops offer solid bittering properties in the 9-11% Alpha Acid range. It also packs one of the highest myrcene oil 
						contents (60-70% of total oils) of any hop. This extremely high Myrcene content gives it a very sweet citrus flavor and aroma 
						that is closer to oranges than grapefruit.
						Amarillo has become one of craft brewer's most favorite hops. It is often paired with Citra, Simcoe, and Mosaic in many juicy 
						IPAs and pale ales.</p>

				<img src="Images/hopsimgs/centennial.jpg" alt="centennial" class="fig-img">
				<figcaption>
					<h2>Type: Centennial</h2>
					<h2>Roots:</h2><p>Centennial hops were first bred in 1974 with a cross between a Brewers Gold and Fuggle hops. Other sources mention it 
						was a cross between Brewers Gold, Fuggle, East Kent Golding, and Bavarian hops. It was named after the Washington State Centennial 
						Celebration, which occurred in 1989, just before it was released to the public in 1990.</p>
					<h2>Flavor & Aroma:</h2><p>Centennial is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process.
						Centennial hops are very similar to Cascade and are characterized by aromatic pine, citrus, and floral notes. It is characterized 
						as having rounded and medium intense floral, citrus and grapefruit flavors and aromas. Other flavors of the Centennial hop include 
						pine needles and tangerines.</p>

				<img src="Images/hopsimgs/simcoe.jpg" alt="simcoe" class="fig-img">
				<figcaption>
					<h2>Type: Simcoe</h2>
					<h2>Roots:</h2><p>Simcoe - previously named YCR 14 - was created by Charles E. Zimmermann, developed by Select Botanicals Group, and released 
						through Yakima Chief Ranches in 2000.
						A patent was applied for the year prior to Simcoe’s release, making it a trademarked variety. Because of this proprietary status its 
						parentage is a secret, but word is that it was derived via open pollination.</p>
					<h2>Flavor & Aroma:</h2><p>Simcoe is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process.
						Alongside its fruity and slightly earthy aromas, specific descriptors of the Simcoe hop includes grapefruit, passion fruit, pine and 
						berry characteristics. In addition to its great bittering qualities, the Simcoe hop variety - often referred to as "Cascade on steroids"
						 - is known for its tropical fruit flavors. It is commonly used in India pale ales and pale ales.
						Simcoe is frequently used for bittering due to its high alpha acid percentages, but can be used as a late addition as well to bring out 
						more fruity aromas. It has since become one of the most popular hops for both the craft beer and homebrewing industries. At 12%-14% Alpha
						Acid, Simcoe adds a smooth bitterness, but also packs a punch of stone fruit, pine, and citrus zest aromas. It truly is a dual purpose 
						hop that is capable of standing on its own in single-hopped beers in a wide range of styles.</p>

				<img src="Images/hopsimgs/saaz.jpg" alt="saaz" class="fig-img">
				<figcaption>
					<h2>Type: Saaz</h2>
					<h2>Roots:</h2><p>Saaz hops were bred from the original centuries-old Czech Republic landrace variety. Czech Saaz hops are of the same lineage, 
						but are grown in the Czech Republic, whereas this variety is grown in the US. The name Saaz is based on the Czech city of Žatec.</p>
					<h2>Flavor & Aroma:</h2><p>Saaz (US) is an aroma hop that is typically used in only late boil additions, including dry hopping.
						Saaz is a noble hop variety, and is considered one of the oldest known. Saaz hops have aromas that include earthiness with a mild spicy 
						flavor to it. Saaz hops - regardless of the country they are grown in - are mostly only used for its aromas due to its low alpha acid 
						content, which results in a delicate bitterness when added at the end of the boil.
						Noble hops like Saaz, are aroma varieties that have an extensive history behind them. The term ‘noble’ has been used since the 1980’s 
						and refers to hops that have been used in brewing beer for centuries.</p>
